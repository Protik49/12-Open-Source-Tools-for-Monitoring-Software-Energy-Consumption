## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How accurate are software energy consumption measurements?</strong></summary>
<p>A: Accuracy varies by tool and approach. Hardware-based measurements (like RAPL) tend to be more accurate but less granular at the software level. Software-based estimations provide more detail but may have accuracy tradeoffs. For most optimization purposes, relative measurements (comparing before and after changes) are more important than absolute accuracy.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Can energy monitoring tools impact performance?</strong></summary>
<p>A: Yes, monitoring tools themselves consume resources. The overhead varies by tool, with some lightweight options adding minimal impact (1-3%) and more comprehensive tools potentially adding more significant overhead (5-15%). It's important to consider this when interpreting results and potentially disable monitoring in production environments.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How do I prioritize energy optimizations?</strong></summary>
<p>A: Focus on the highest impact areas first:
<ol>
<li>Identify the most energy-intensive components using profiling tools</li>
<li>Prioritize frequently executed code paths</li>
<li>Consider the scale of deployment (optimizing code that runs on millions of devices has multiplied impact)</li>
<li>Balance energy optimization with other concerns like performance and maintainability</li>
</ol>
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Are there industry standards for software energy efficiency?</strong></summary>
<p>A: The field is still evolving, but several emerging standards exist:
<ul>
<li>The Green Software Foundation's Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification</li>
<li>Energy Star ratings for software (in development)</li>
<li>ISO/IEC 23643 for measuring software energy efficiency</li>
<li>The Sustainable ICT Assessment Framework (SICTAF)</li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How do different programming languages compare in energy efficiency?</strong></summary>
<p>A: Generally, compiled languages (C, C++, Rust) tend to be more energy-efficient than interpreted languages (Python, JavaScript). However, the specific implementation matters more than the language choice. Well-optimized code in any language will outperform poorly written code in an "efficient" language. For critical paths, consider using compiled languages or native extensions.</p>
